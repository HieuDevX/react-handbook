title: Arrow Functions
description: 'Arrow Functions are one of the most impactful changes in ES6/ES2015, and they are widely used nowadays. They slightly differ from regular functions. Find out how'

Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 / ECMAScript 2015, and since their introduction they changed forever how JavaScript code looks (and works).

In my opinion this change was so welcoming that you now rarely see in modern codebases the usage of the `function` keyword.

Visually, itâ€™s a simple and welcome change, which allows you to write functions with a shorter syntax, from:

```js
const myFunction = function foo() {
  //...
}
```

to

```js
const myFunction = () => {
  //...
}
```

If the function body contains just a single statement, you can omit the brackets and write all on a single line:

```js
const myFunction = () => doSomething()
```

Parameters are passed in the parentheses:

```js
const myFunction = (param1, param2) => doSomething(param1, param2)
```

If you have one (and just one) parameter, you could omit the parentheses completely:

```js
const myFunction = param => doSomething(param)
```

Thanks to this short syntax, arrow functions **encourage the use of small functions**.

## Implicit return

Arrow functions allow you to have an implicit return: values are returned without having to use the `return` keyword.

It works when there is a on-line statement in the function body:

```js
const myFunction = () => 'test'

myFunction() //'test'
```

Another example, returning an object (remember to wrap the curly brackets in parentheses to avoid it being considered the wrapping function body brackets):

```js
const myFunction = () => ({ value: 'test' })

myFunction() //{value: 'test'}
```

## How `this` works in arrow functions

`this` is a concept that can be complicated to grasp, as it varies a lot depending on the context and also varies depending on the mode of JavaScript (_strict mode_ or not).

It's important to clarify this concept because arrow functions behave very differently compared to regular functions.

When defined as a method of an object, in a regular function `this` refers to the object, so you can do:

```js
const car = {
  model: 'Fiesta',
  manufacturer: 'Ford',
  fullName: function() {
    return `${this.manufacturer} ${this.model}`
  }
}
```

calling `car.fullName()` will return `"Ford Fiesta"`.

The `this` scope with arrow functions is **inherited** from the execution context. An arrow function does not bind `this` at all, so its value will be looked up in the call stack, so in this code `car.fullName()` will not work, and will return the string `"undefined undefined"`:

```js
const car = {
  model: 'Fiesta',
  manufacturer: 'Ford',
  fullName: () => {
    return `${this.manufacturer} ${this.model}`
  }
}
```

Due to this, arrow functions are not suited as object methods.

Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors as well, when instantiating an object will raise a `TypeError`.

This is where regular functions should be used instead, **when dynamic context is not needed**.

This is also a problem when handling events. DOM Event listeners set `this` to be the target element, and if you rely on `this` in an event handler, a regular function is necessary:

```js
const link = document.querySelector('#link')
link.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // this === window
})
```

```js
const link = document.querySelector('#link')
link.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // this === link
})
```
